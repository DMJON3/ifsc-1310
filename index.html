    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
     <p>I believe one of the most important sections of a HTMl doc is the style sheet, before doing this project I 
      never really understood the importance of CSS. On CSS I learned that it is very easy to work with, however 
      its also very easy to look over mistakes or not close out certain elements(which is why you validate the code!). 
      Having no stylesheet to me is the equivalent of having no paint on a car, you dont neccessiarily have to have it but, it 
      would make your life and everyone elses 5x better. </p>
      <p>Overall my experience for this semester at least learing wise was pretty quick, I absorbed and learned the content in a
        timely manner, and yes, you have to look at the resources in the course and try some things on your own, alone, or else 
        you WILL be overwhelmed. Learning HTML5 was like learning how to ride a bike, the 2nd or 4th time it just becomes natrual,
        from forgetting to ID elements to then now, writing code without thinking and making websites from the ground up(with very little external help).
        It had never dawned on me how much effort it really takes(depending on the builder) to proofread a website and still absouletly miss 
        the most simple things, such as my first Dragon X Site, my freinds noted that I was missing the "Space X 2020" footer, which was fixed in the revision, 
        other than the font and background my freinds otherwise quite enjoyed my website prasing its simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>In all honesty I will admit that I did alot more wrong than I did right during this semster. On the "right" I did my own research outside
        of the class, learning more about the topics at hand and playing around with it in Codepen, so I absorbed the information well...now for the bad. The 
        bad is first, my atriocious time management skills which led to more stress in the long run, and second, my lack of communication with my professor onto 
        why I was missing deadlines in the first place, as these past few months have had back-to-back life changing events happen pretty much weekly. So what would 
        I do if I could start over? Try alot harder to keep up and not let my personal life and affairs consume me, and maintain more contact with my professor.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>My interpretation and understanding of Progressive Enhancement is that it is basically a mindset on how to properly format and create a functional website.
      Progressive Enchancement can come in a myriad of analogies, but they are all layered like a website should be, content->marked HTML->CSS(stylesheet)->javascript.
      Websites are purely made from preference wether that is your own or whomever you may be making it for, some may just want the content, others may want only the 
      content and a small amount of CSS, and others may want everything
      you can throw at it and the kitchen sink!</p>
      Now why is progressive enhancement so important? Content, and how it is displayed, that is what a website is meant to do all together, is to display a set amount 
      of content in a visually pleasing manner.
